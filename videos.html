        </div>

        <p class="information">
            The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a men's T20 franchise cricket league in India. It is annually contested
            by
            ten teams based in seven cities and three states.[1][2] The league was founded by the Board of Control for
            Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2007. Brijesh Patel is the incumbent chairman of IPL.[3] It is usually held
            annually
            in summer across India between March to May and has an exclusive window in the ICC Future Tours
            Programme.[4]

            The IPL is the most-attended cricket league in the world. In 2014, it was ranked sixth by average attendance
            among all sports leagues.[5] In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event in the world to be broadcast
            live
            on YouTube.[6][7] The brand value of the IPL in 2022 was ₹90,038 crore (US$11 billion).[8] According to
            BCCI,
            the 2015 IPL season contributed ₹1,150 crore (US$140 million) to the GDP of the Indian economy.[9] [needs
            update]

            So far there have been fifteen seasons of the IPL tournament. The current IPL title holder franchise is
            Gujarat
            Titans, winning the 2022 season and their first season.

            History
            Background
            The Indian Cricket League (ICL) was founded in 2007, with funding provided by Zee Entertainment
            Enterprises.[10]
            The ICL was not recognised by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) or the International Cricket
            Council (ICC) and the BCCI were not pleased with its committee members joining the ICL executive board.[11]
            To
            prevent players from joining the ICL, the BCCI increased the prize money in their own domestic tournaments
            and
            also imposed lifetime bans on players joining the ICL, which was considered a rebel league by the
            board.[12][13]

            Foundation
            The IPL has been designed to entice an entire new generation of sports fans into the grounds throughout the
            country. The dynamic Twenty20 format has been designed to attract a young fan base, which also includes
            women
            and children.

            — Lalit Modi during the launch of the IPL.[14]
            On 13 September 2007,[14] on the back of India's victory at the 2007 T20 World Cup,[15] BCCI announced a
            franchise-based Twenty20 cricket competition called Indian Premier League. The first season was slated to
            start
            in April 2008, in a "high-profile ceremony" in New Delhi. BCCI vice-president Lalit Modi, who spearheaded
            the
            IPL effort, spelled out the details of the tournament including its format, the prize money, franchise
            revenue
            system and squad composition rules. It was also revealed that the IPL would be run by a seven-man governing
            council composed of former India players and BCCI officials and that the top two teams of the IPL would
            qualify
            for that year's Champions League Twenty20. Modi also clarified that they had been working on the idea for
            two
            years and that the IPL was not started as a "knee-jerk reaction" to the ICL.[14] The league's format was
            similar
            to that of the Premier League of England and the NBA in the United States.[13]

            In order to decide the owners for the new league, an auction was held on 24 January 2008 with the total base
            prices of the franchises costing around $400 million.[13] At the end of the auction, the winning bidders
            were
            announced, as well as the cities the teams would be based in: Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Jaipur,
            Kolkata, Mohali, and Mumbai.[13] In the end, the franchises were all sold for a total of $723.59
            million.[16]
            The Indian Cricket League soon folded in 2008.[17]

            Players of Pakistan are not allowed to take part in the league since the 2008 Mumbai terrorist attacks, due
            to
            the involvement of Pakistan in that attack, 166 people lost their lives and 238 were gravely injured. The
            odious
            attack widespread angered many Indians, resulting in a total ban of Pakistani players in the
            IPL.[18][19][20][21]

            Expansions and terminations

            Crowd during a match of the 2015 IPL season in Hyderabad, India.
            On 21 March 2010, two new franchises – Pune Warriors India and Kochi Tuskers Kerala – joined the league
            before
            the fourth season in 2011.[22] Sahara Adventure Sports Group bought the Pune franchise for $370 million
            while
            Rendezvous Sports World bought the Kochi franchise for $333.3 million.[22] However, one year later, on 11
            November 2011, it was announced that the Kochi Tuskers Kerala side would be terminated following the side
            breaching the BCCI's terms of conditions.[23]

            Then, on 14 September 2012, following the team not being able to find new owners, the BCCI announced that
            the
            2009 champions, the Deccan Chargers, would be terminated.[24] The next month, on 25 October, an auction was
            held
            to see who would be the owner of the replacement franchise, with Sun TV Network winning the bid for the
            Hyderabad franchise.[25] The team would be named Sunrisers Hyderabad.[26]

            Pune Warriors India withdrew from the IPL on 21 May 2013 over financial differences with the BCCI.[27] The
            franchise was officially terminated by the BCCI, on 26 October 2013, on account of the franchise failing to
            provide the necessary bank guarantee.[28]

            On 14 June 2015, it was announced that two-time champions, Chennai Super Kings, and the inaugural season
            champions, Rajasthan Royals, would be suspended for two seasons following their role in a spot-fixing and
            betting scandal.[29] Then, on 8 December 2015, following an auction, it was revealed that Pune and Rajkot
            would
            replace Chennai and Rajasthan for two seasons.[30] The two teams were the Rising Pune Supergiant and the
            Gujarat
            Lions.[31]

            The venue for the 2020 season was moved due to the COVID-19 pandemic and games were played in the United
            Arab
            Emirates.[32][33] In August 2021, the BCCI announced that two new franchises would join the league starting
            from
            the 2022 season. It was also announced that the franchises would be based in two of the six cities
            shortlisted
            by the BCCI; Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Cuttack, Guwahati, Ranchi and Dharamshala.[34][35] In a closed bidding held
            on
            25 October, RPSG Group and CVC Capital won bids for the two teams. RPSG paid ₹7,000 crore (US$880 million)
            for
            Lucknow, whereas CVC won Ahmedabad for ₹5,200 crore (US$650 million).[36][37] The teams were subsequently
            named
            Lucknow Super Giants and Gujarat Titans.

            changed.
            It needs to be updated.. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available
            information. (January 2023)
            IPL's headquarters are situated inside the Cricket centre at the Wankhede Stadium in Churchgate, Mumbai. The
            IPL
            Governing Council is responsible for all the functions of the tournament.

            The members are:[38][39][40]

            Arun Dhumal – Chairman
            Jay Shah – BCCI Secretary
            Ashish Shelar – BCCI Treasurer
            Avishek Dalmiya - IPL Governing council member
            MKhairul Jamal Majumdar – APEX council member
            Pragyan Ojha – Indian Cricketers' Association's representative
            Alka Rehani Bhardwaj – Comptroller and Auditor General of India nominee
            Organisation
            Player acquisition, squad composition and salaries
            A team can acquire players through any of the three ways: the annual player auction, trading players with
            other
            teams during the trading windows, and signing replacements for unavailable players. Players sign up for the
            auction and also set their base price, and are bought by the franchise that bids the highest for them.
            Unsold
            players at the auction are eligible to be signed up as replacement signings. In the trading windows, a
            player
            can only be traded with his consent, with the franchise paying the difference if any between the old and new
            contracts. If the new contract is worth more than the older one, the difference is shared between the player
            and
            the franchise selling the player. There are generally three trading windows—two before the auction and one
            after
            the auction but before the start of the tournament. Players cannot be traded outside the trading windows or
            during the tournament, whereas replacements can be signed before or during the tournament.

            Some of the team composition rules (as of 2020 season) are as follows:

            The squad strength must be between 18 and 25 players, with a maximum of 8 overseas players.
            Salary cap of the entire squad must not exceed ₹85 crore (US$11 million).[41]
            Under-19 players cannot be picked unless they have previously played first-class or List A cricket.
            A team can play a maximum of 4 overseas players in their playing eleven.[42]
            The term of a player contract is one year, with the franchise having the option to extend the contract by
            one or
            two years. Since the 2014 season, the player contracts are denominated in the Indian rupee, before which the
            contracts were in U.S. dollars. Overseas players can be remunerated in the currency of the player's choice
            at
            the exchange rate on either the contract due date or the actual date of payment.[43] Prior to the 2014
            season,
            Indian domestic players were not included in the player auction pool and could be signed up by the
            franchises at
            a discrete amount while a fixed sum of ₹10 lakh (US$13,000) to ₹30 lakh (US$38,000) would get deducted per
            signing from the franchise's salary purse. This received significant opposition from franchise owners who
            complained that richer franchises were "luring players with under-the-table deals" following which the IPL
            decided to include domestic players in the player auction.[44]

            According to a 2015 survey by Sporting Intelligence and ESPN The Magazine, the average IPL salary when
            pro-rated
            is US$4.33 million per year, the second highest among all sports leagues in the world. Since the players in
            the
            IPL are only contracted for the duration of the tournament (less than two months), the weekly IPL salaries
            are
            extrapolated pro rata to obtain an average annual salary, unlike other sports leagues in which players are
            contracted by a single team for the entire year.[45]

            Match rules
            IPL games utilise television timeouts and hence there is no time limit in which teams must complete their
            innings. However, a penalty may be imposed if the umpires find teams misusing this privilege. Each team is
            given
            a two-and-a-half-minute "strategic timeout" during each innings; one must be taken by the bowling team
            between
            the ends of the 6th and 9th overs, and one by the batting team between the ends of the 13th and 16th
            overs.[46]

            Since the 2018 season, the Umpire Decision Review System is being used in all IPL matches, allowing each
            team
            two chances to review an on-field umpire's decision per innings.[47]

            Prize money
            The 2019 season of the IPL offered a total prize money of ₹50 crore (equivalent to ₹53 crore or US$6.6
            million
            in 2020), with the winning team netting ₹20 crore (equivalent to ₹21 crore or US$2.6 million in 2020). The
            first
            and second runners up received ₹12.5 crore (US$1.6 million) and ₹8.75 crore (US$1.1 million), respectively,
            with
            the fourth placed team also winning ₹8.75 crore (US$1.1 million).[48] The other teams are not awarded any
            prize
            money. The IPL rules mandate that half of the prize money must be distributed among the players.[49]
